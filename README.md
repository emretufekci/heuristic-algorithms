Heuristic Algorithms

This repository contains Python implementations of three popular heuristic optimization 
algorithms: Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Dolphin 
Echolocation.

Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)

Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is a heuristic optimization algorithm that is inspired by the 
behavior of ants in nature. It is used to find approximate solutions to complex optimization 
problems.

The ACO algorithm works by simulating the behavior of a group of ants searching for a solution to 
a problem. Each ant independently searches for a solution by following the paths with the highest 
pheromone levels, which are chemicals that ants use to communicate with each other. As the ants 
explore the search space, they leave pheromone trails on the paths they take, which helps other 
ants find good solutions more easily.

The ACO algorithm can be implemented in Python by defining a function that initializes a group of 
ants with random starting positions, and then iteratively updates their positions based on the 
pheromone levels on the paths between the positions. The pheromone levels can be updated based on 
the quality of the solutions found by the ants.

Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)

Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a heuristic optimization algorithm that is inspired by the 
behavior of social animals, such as birds and fish. It is used to find approximate solutions to 
complex optimization problems.

The PSO algorithm works by simulating a group of particles moving through a search space and 
updating their positions based on their own best positions, the global best position found by the 
group, and random perturbations. The global best position is the position with the lowest value in 
the search space.

The PSO algorithm can be implemented in Python by defining a function that initializes a group of 
particles with random positions and velocities, and then iteratively updates their positions and 
velocities based on the global best position and random perturbations. The positions and 
velocities of the particles can be updated using equations that incorporate the particles' own 
best positions, the global best position, and random perturbations.

Dolphin Echolocation

Dolphin echolocation is a process that dolphins use to locate objects and navigate through their 
environment. They produce high-frequency sounds and listen for the echoes that bounce back when 
the sounds hit an object.

It is difficult to create a specific code for dolphin echolocation, as it is a complex biological 
process that involves the production and perception of sounds by dolphins. However, it is possible 
to simulate the process of echolocation in Python by defining a function that calculates the time 
it takes for a sound to travel to an object and back, and uses that time to estimate the distance 
to the object and the position of the object.

This repository was created by Emre Tufekci for the Heuristic Algorithms course at Istanbul 
Cerrahpasa University, taught by Assoc. Prof. Emel Arslan.
